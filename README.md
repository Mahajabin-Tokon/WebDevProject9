Learn about pseudo selectors by building a balance sheet

Learned about:
- table elements which includes: thead, tbody, tr, th, td
- how to select all span elements with a specific class
- clip property
- hide information while ensuring it is read by the search engine
- :first-of-type pseudo-selector
- calc() function
- how to select any element with a class regardless of value
- :not() pseudo-selector
- !important keyword
- [attribute="value"] selector
- The difference between tr[class="total"] and tr.total is that the first will select tr elements where the only class is total. The second will select tr elements where the class includes total.
- :nth-of-type() pseudo-selector
